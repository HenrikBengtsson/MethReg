<!-- badges: end -->

`coMethTF` can be used to generate testable hypothesis on the
synergistic interaction of DMRs and TFs in gene regulation. `coMethTF`
can be used either to evaluate regulatory potentials of candidate
regions or to search for methylation coupled TF regulatory processes in
the entire genome.

## Installation

You can install the released version of coMethTF from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("TransBioInfoLab/coMethTF")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(coMethTF)
#> Setting options('download.file.method.GEOquery'='auto')
#> Setting options('GEOquery.inmemory.gpl'=FALSE)
## basic example code
```
